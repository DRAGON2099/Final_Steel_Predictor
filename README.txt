This Repository contains all relevant code files in order to create a Steel Prediction Model capable of predicting The composition via user inputing the Steel Properties namely UTS, Yield Strength, Elongation and Reduction in Area.
Sinilarly, Vice-Versa where it predicts the 4 properties of the Steel as well depending on Composition selected by user.
Finally, it even predicts the Heat treatment involved in further improvement of Steel.

In order to Run/Execute the Code :-

1) Run python app.py - It contains all the relevant python code using pandas,sckit.learn etc in order to facilitate the working of the model.
2) Create a launch.json file in order to run a chrome instance with web security disable in order to be able to read the excel sheet and csv files provided, however, feel free to use your own and modify the code to not require an instance with web security disabled.

The Application has files for User Authentication, Login etc in order to turn it into a commercial app in the future as well.

Feel free to run html files and experiment with the order to link other files and experiment with the order the website works.
